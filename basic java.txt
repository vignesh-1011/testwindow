3.Types of Variables
There are three types of variables in Java
:

local variable
instance variable
static variable
             Example:
public class A  
{  
    static int m=100;//static variable  
    void method()  
    {    
        int n=90;//local variable    
    }  
    public static void main(String args[])  
    {  
        int data=50;//instance variable    
    }  
}//end of class 
           4.Data Types in Java
Primitive data types: The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double.
Non-primitive data types: The non-primitive data types include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.
